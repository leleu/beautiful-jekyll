# Data Philosophy
Data can have a big impact on understanding the world, illuminating dark corners that were previously unknown.  It can also be used inappropriately -- *for support rather than illumination* -- even unknowingly.  Getting the answer you want, because you want it and unconsciously inject bias, is often worse than no answer.

If you find yourself reaching for data to confirm you're right, **you are wrong.**
